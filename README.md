# Hopf Oscillator Coupling Simulation Report

## Introduction:

The objective of this simulation is to study the coupling of two Hopf oscillators under different coupling scenarios - complex coupling and power coupling. The Hopf oscillator equations describe the dynamics of each oscillator in terms of its position coordinates \(x\) and \(y\). The coupling is introduced to investigate the influence of one oscillator on the other.

The Hopf oscillator equations are given by:

\[
\begin{align*}
\dot{x} &= -y + \mu x (1 - x^2 - y^2) \\
\dot{y} &= x + \mu y (1 - x^2 - y^2)
\end{align*}
\]

## Implementation:

### Hopf Oscillator Equations:

The code implements these equations using a numerical integration approach (Euler's method). The `hopf_oscillator` function takes the current \(x\), \(y\), and \(\mu\) values and returns the increments \(\Delta x\) and \(\Delta y\) for the next time step.

### Complex Coupling:

For complex coupling, the phase differences to be achieved are 47⁰ and 98⁰. The complex coupling is introduced by adding terms proportional to the difference in \(x\) and \(y\) of the oscillators, multiplied by complex exponential terms with given phase differences (\(\omega_{12}\) and \(\omega_{21}\)). The coupling coefficients are calculated as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Complex Coupling 1: } & \omega_{12} = \text{np.deg2rad}(47) \\
\text{Complex Coupling 2: } & \omega_{21} = \text{np.deg2rad}(98)
\end{align*}
\]

The `complex_coupling` function is responsible for updating the oscillator equations with the complex coupling terms.

### Power Coupling:

For power coupling, the normalized phase differences to be achieved are 47⁰ and 98⁰. The power coupling is introduced by adding terms proportional to the difference in \(x\) of the oscillators, multiplied by the given angular frequencies (\(\omega_{12}\) and \(\omega_{21}\)). The coupling coefficients are calculated as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Power Coupling 1: } & \omega_{12} = \text{np.deg2rad}(47) \\
\text{Power Coupling 2: } & \omega_{21} = \text{np.deg2rad}(98)
\end{align*}
\]

The `power_coupling` function is responsible for updating the oscillator equations with the power coupling terms.

### Simulation Parameters:

The simulation is performed over a time range of 0 to 100 with a time step (\(dt\)) of 0.01. Initial conditions for \(x\) and \(y\) are set to 0.5.

## Results and Plots:

### Complex Coupling:

The responses of \(x\) and \(y\) for both oscillators under complex coupling are plotted over time. The phase differences of 47⁰ and 98⁰ are achieved through the specified complex coupling coefficients.

### Power Coupling:

Similarly, the responses of \(x\) and \(y\) for both oscillators under power coupling are plotted over time. The normalized phase differences of 47⁰ and 98⁰ are achieved through the specified power coupling coefficients.

### Polar Coordinates:

Polar coordinate plots can be created by transforming Cartesian coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) to polar coordinates \(r\) and \(\theta\). This transformation is given by:

\[
\begin{align*}
r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
\theta &= \text{arctan2}(y, x)
\end{align*}
\]

These polar coordinates can be used to visualize the trajectories of the oscillators in the polar plane.

## Conclusion:

The simulation provides insights into the behavior of coupled Hopf oscillators under different coupling conditions. The code can be further extended for more complex scenarios and parameter variations. The polar coordinate plots enhance the visualization of the oscillator trajectories.

## Code and Acknowledgments:
